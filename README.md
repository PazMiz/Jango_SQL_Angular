Angular, SQL, and Django Combine
This project combines Angular, SQL, and Django to create a full-stack web application. It leverages the power of Angular for the front-end development, SQL for the database management, and Django as the back-end framework.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: Install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) to run the Angular application.

Angular CLI: Install the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) globally using npm by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g @angular/cli
Python and Django: Install Python and Django to set up the Django back-end. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org) and Django using pip:

Copy code
pip install django
SQL Database: Set up a SQL database server (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) and ensure you have the necessary credentials and connection details.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

Clone the repository: https://github.com/PazMiz/Jango_SQL_Angular.git

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/PazMiz/Jango_SQL_Angular.git
Front-end (Angular) setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the Angular development server:
Copy code
ng serve
Access the Angular application in your browser at http://localhost:4200.
Back-end (Django) setup:

Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Apply database migrations:
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Start the Django development server:
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
The Django server will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.
Configure the SQL database:

Update the database configuration in the Django settings file (backend/settings.py) to match your SQL database credentials and connection details.
